install tampermonkey from https://chromewebstore.google.com/   (look up tampermonkey), and then make a new script and paste in the contents of `index.js`
then go to wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

use the nice panel, the first word is mathematically the best. bot mode works well.
will attach stats after I use it more, but i beat wordles bot :)
