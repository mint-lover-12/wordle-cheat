install tampermonkey from https://chromewebstore.google.com/   (look up tampermonkey), and then make a new script and paste in the contents of `index.js`
then go to wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

use the nice panel, the first word is mathematically the best. bot mode works well.
will attach stats after I use it more, but i beat wordles bot :)


also stop button doesnt work idrc abt it

**technical**
- 
for this i needed:
To get wordles wordlist.
I got it, then I just pull letters and their colours, compare, and zamnnmnmn
algorithm is decent, I dont see how it could be improved without adding it a list of common words or something like that.

overall pretty easy to do, cant wait for wordle to add an anticheat ;)
